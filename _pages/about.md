I am a senior at the University of Houston pursuing a degree in Computer Science (B.S.). I currently maintain a 3.735 GPA and am expected to graduate in Fall 2026. Attending the [Department of Computer Science](cs.uh.edu) at the College of Natural Science and Mathematics has made me proficient in basic programming skills while also allowing me the opportunity to learn more about automata theory, algorithms relating to data structures, and operating systems. This semester, I am eager to expand into the fields of artificial intelligence, data science, and database systems. I have coded projects in Java, Python, and briefly HTML; however, I have the most experience with C++. That being said, I feel that I am quick to grasp new concepts and unafraid to learn from my mistakes.

Outside of school, I have worked for nearly three years in the service industry, enhancing my skills regarding flexibility and teamwork. I've mastered the ability to put aside personal issues to get a job done. No matter how a shift is going, I am confident in my ability to bounce back from errors and ultimately thrive in fast-paced environments.

Upon completion of my undergraduate studies, I am considering either applying to graduate school to further advance my education or beginning to search for jobs and internships, hopefully in the fields of machine learning and data science.
